### In this project we will be deploying deep learning model to heroku using flask

### These are the steps we will follow

- [x] Training our model using tensorflow
- [x] Creating web app using flask
- [x] Commit code into Github
- [x] Linking Github to Heroku
- [x] WebÂ app is done

### First step

- First step is we need to build the model using any library and save it.
- I will be building a CNN model on MNIST data and saving it

### Second step

- After building the model, we need to create a flask app which is used to serve the model.
- We will be using flask to create a web app.

### Third step

- Now after creating model and web app, the next step is to commit the entire code to Github by creating a new repository(optional)
- Create account on heroku and see how to deploy it using CLI option or connect directly to github and deploy it

### Fourth step

- Now it's time to create Heroku account, after creating that we can push the complete code to heroku.

### Fifth step

- Test your web app
